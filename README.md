# Qualcomm CDI generator

Tooling to generate CDI config files to pass devices through to containers

The generated files conform to the [Container Device Interface (CDI)
specification](https://github.com/cncf-tags/container-device-interface) from
the CNCF, so they can be consumed by any CDI-aware container runtime and
validated with the upstream `cdi` tool (see [Validating generated CDI
files](#validating-generated-cdi-files)).

## Branches

**main**: Primary development branch. Contributors should develop submissions based on this branch, and submit pull requests to this branch.

## Requirements

The main tool only requires python3 to generate a CDI. To consume it, you need a container runtime like podman or docker.

Recent versions of Podman (5.6.x) and Docker (28.3.x) work out of the box, for earlier Docker versions (26.x–27.x) you'll need a `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
  "features": {
     "cdi": true
  },
  "cdi-spec-dirs": ["/etc/cdi/", "/run/cdi"]
}
```

For Docker 28.0.x only the feature enablement is needed:
```json
{
  "features": {
     "cdi": true
  }
}
```

Either restart the docker daemon or reboot to have this config take effect.

> **Note:** Docker 26.x shows the configured `CDI spec directories` in `docker info` but does not list `Discovered Devices`. Devices are still available for use with `--device`; the "Discovered Devices" section only appears in Docker 28.x and later.

## Installation Instructions

Copy over `qualcomm-cdi-generator.py`

## Usage

On the target, run the CDI generator as root. The output directory `/run/cdi` is created automatically:

```shell
# qualcomm-cdi-generator.py
```

The tool probes the hardware, writes one CDI JSON file per device class under `/run/cdi`, and writes a hook script to `/bin/vendorhook`. Run with `-v` to see what was found and written, or `-vv` for full debug output.

A udev rule (`99-qualcomm-cdi-generator.rules`) restarts `qualcomm-cdi-generator.service` whenever a GPU render node, V4L2 device, DMA-BUF heap, or FastRPC CDSP/ADSP node is added or removed, so the generated CDI files stay in sync with hotplugged hardware without a reboot.

### Command-line options

| Option | Long form | Default | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `-d` | `--destdir` | `/` | Root directory for all output paths |
| `-H` | `--hookfilename` | `vendorhook` | Hook script filename written under `<destdir>/bin/` |
| `-c` | `--cdifilename` | `qualcomm.json` | CDI filename base; the device class is inserted before the extension, e.g. `qualcomm.json` → `qualcomm-gpu.json` |
| `-C` | `--classes` | all | Comma-separated list of CDI classes to generate. Available: `gpu`, `v4l2`, `dmaheap`, `fastrpc-cdsp`, `fastrpc-adsp` |
| `-n` | `--dry-run` | off | Probe devices but do not write any files |
| `-v` | `--verbose` | off | Increase verbosity; use `-vv` for debug output |

```

You can then pass one or more of the above entries to the runtime:
```shell
(cdi) root@ventunoq:~# docker run --network host --device qualcomm.com/gpu=renderD128 --device=qualcomm.com/fastrpc-cdsp=fastrpc-cdsp:all --rm -it aiml-container:latest /bin/bash
```
When using a CDI device, the container will automatically get additional metadata, for example the `MACHINE_NAME` environment variable:
```shell
(cdi) root@ventunoq:~# docker run --network host --device=qualcomm.com/fastrpc-cdsp=fastrpc-cdsp:all --rm -it aiml-container:latest /bin/bash
root@container:/# env | grep MACHINE
MACHINE_NAME=Arduino Monza
```

To generate only the fastrpc classes:
```shell
(cdi) root@ventunoq:~# qualcomm-cdi-generator.py --classes fastrpc-cdsp,fastrpc-adsp -v

```

### CDI file structure

The tool writes one JSON file per device class. Each file has a `kind` matching its class (e.g. `qualcomm.com/gpu`). The `fastrpc` files additionally include bind-mounts for Hexagon DSP firmware found under `/usr/share/*/*/*/*/dsp/` and the devicetree model string, since those binaries are tightly coupled to the in-kernel firmware loader.

Example `qualcomm-gpu.json`:
```json
{
  "cdiVersion": "0.6.0",
  "kind": "qualcomm.com/gpu",
  "devices": [
    {
      "name": "renderD128",
      "containerEdits": {
        "deviceNodes": [ { "path": "/dev/dri/renderD128" } ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "renderD:all",
      "containerEdits": {
        "deviceNodes": [ { "path": "/dev/dri/renderD128" } ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "containerEdits": {
    "hooks": [ { "hookName": "createContainer", "path": "/bin/vendorhook" } ],
    "env": [ "MACHINE_NAME=Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Robotics RB3gen2" ]
  }
}
```

## Validating generated CDI files

The generated JSON files follow the [CNCF Container Device Interface
specification](https://github.com/cncf-tags/container-device-interface), whose
`cdi` command-line tool can validate spec files against the CDI JSON schema.

Point `cdi validate` at a directory of spec files with `--spec-dirs` (it
scans `/etc/cdi` and `/var/run/cdi` by default) and it exits non-zero on any
load or schema error. Validation checks only the spec structure — the
referenced device nodes need not exist on the validating machine:

```shell
$ cdi validate --spec-dirs /run/cdi
No CDI Registry errors.
```

## Running the tests

The stand-alone `unittest` suite under [tests/](tests/) exercises the
spec-building helpers and validates generated CDI files with the `cdi` tool.
It needs only the Python standard library; the validation tests additionally
need `cdi`, located via the `CDI_TOOL` environment variable or `PATH` and
skipped when it is not found.

```shell
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
CDI_TOOL=/path/to/cdi python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
